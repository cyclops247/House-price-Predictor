\# House Price Prediction – Data Preprocessing



This repository contains the data preprocessing work for a House Price Prediction machine learning project.



\## Current Status

\- Data preprocessing implemented using Jupyter Notebook

\- Dataset cleaning and feature scaling

\- Visualization of results
\- splitted the data succesfully for train and test 
\- used stratified split
\- made a pipeline 
\- used decision tree regressor as model



\## Files

\- Jupyter Notebook: preprocessing code

\- Output image: preprocessing results



\## Next Steps

\- Model training

\- Model evaluation

\- Prediction pipeline
